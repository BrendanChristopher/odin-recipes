        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine protein with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil in a large skillet and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat, until the fat has rendered and protein is crisp, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large, heatproof mixing bowl, whisk together whole eggs and yolks, Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and black pepper</li>
            <li>Using tongs, transfer pasta to skillet with crisped protein and its fat; do not drain boiling pasta water. Add remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil to pasta and stir to combine; let cool slightly. Scrape pasta, protein, and all the fat into the egg mixture. Measure 1/2 cup (120 ml) pasta-cookiing water and add to pasta and egg mixture. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Set mixing bowl over pot of boiling water to make a double boiler (make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water) and cook, stirring quickly with tongs, until sauce thickens to a creamy, silky consistency and leaves a trail as you stir. Remove from heat, season with salt (if needed), and divide into bowls. Serve immediately, topping with more grated cheese and freshly ground pepper, as desired.</li>
        </ol>
