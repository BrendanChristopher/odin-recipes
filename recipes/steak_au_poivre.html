        <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) brandy or cognac</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (174 ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (175 ml) heavy cream <b>or</b> 6 tablespoons (90 ml) creme fraiche</li>

    </ul>
<!-- Directions on how to cook -->
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Genereously season with Kosher Salt. Set on a wire-rack over a baking sheet and allow to air dry, uncovered, in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the salt penetrates the steak, crack peppercorns into rough halves and quarters. You can use a pepper mill on the coarsest setting, or use a meat pounder or skillet to crush them. Make sure to wrap the peppercorns in a clean towel first to contain them.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Spread cracked peppercorns onto a plate or another shallow dish and press one side of each steak into the pepper, to encrust the steak. Set each steak aside, peppercorn side up. Reserve any remaining peppercorns.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add steaks, peppercorn side down, and cook until peppercorns are well toasted, about 3 minutes. Turn the steaks carefully, to not break the crust. Add butter, thyme, and garlic and cook, basting steaks with a spoon, until steaks are well seared on second side (about three minutes). Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer steaks to a rimmed baking sheet. Check internal temperature of the steaks; if they've reached 125&deg;F (52&deg;C), they're ready to be served medium-rare. If they haven't reached their final doneness, transfer to oven and continue cooking until internal temperature reaches 125&deg;F. Once internal temperature is reached, allow steaks to rest for 5 minutes off heat.</li>
        <li>Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from skillet and discard garlic and thyme. Add shallot and any reserved cracked peppercorns, return to medium heat, and cook, stirring, until shallot is tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add brandy or cognac. To prevent flare-ups, turn off the burner, add alcohol, then reignite the burner. Cook until raw alcohol smell has burned off and brandy has almost completely evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping any fond from the bottom of the pan with a wooden utensil. Whisk in cream, then simmer, stirring often, until sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Whisk in mustard, and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Arrange steaks on plates and pour sauce over top. Serve with your favorite sides, and enjoy!</li>
